# I utilize the code below to read all csv files from a directory and combine it to one single data set.
# For instance, I have a bunch of csv files saved in a folder: "C:/Users/YOURNAME/". And I'd like to read all those csv files and combine
# them into one single data set.


# First set up the working directory to the folder which holds all the files that you'd like to read. I experienced permission issues
# without doing so.
setwd("C:/Users/YOURNAME/")

# Second, lists all csv files in this folder
file_list = list.files(pattern="*.csv")

# Last, Read files and combine them.
myfiles = do.call(rbind,lapply(file_list, read.csv))
